The Skin Care System is a Python-based program that helps users understand their skin type and build personalized skincare routines. By asking simple questions about skin type, concerns, and habits, the program suggests daily routines and tracks skin progress over time. It’s designed to make skincare easy, consistent, and data-driven.
# Skin Care System

The Skin Care System is a Python-based program that asks users simple questions about their skin type and concerns to create personalized skincare routines and track their progress over time. The goal is to make skincare easier, more consistent, and data-driven.

## How It Works
- The program asks users about their skin type (oily, dry, combination, etc.) and concerns (acne, redness, dryness, etc.).
- It recommends a morning and night skincare routine based on the answers.
- Users can log their skin updates and visualize progress over time using Python charts.

## Future Plans
- Add reminders for AM/PM routines.
- Include ingredient explanations (e.g., niacinamide, hyaluronic acid).
